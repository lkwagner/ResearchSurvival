## Prep for the meeting

On the Box folder `Weekly meetings with lucas` there is a folder `Data Repository`. Either there will be a folder with your name on it or make one. 

In this folder, make another folder with the date of the meeting. In this folder, there should be: 
 * A brief summary: 
    - Overall goal and where we are on that goal (big questions)
    - What questions we set out to resolve last time. 
    - Results that you believe resolve that question. 
    - What the next open questions are to get to the overall goal
* Data and plotting scripts used to generate the results. Data should be either:
    - ``Tidy'' format (CSV with each row an observation and columns for all important data)
    - HDF5 format with well-defined keys. (I prefer CSV)
* Input files/scripts that you use to submit your jobs, in particular if you are having trouble doing something.
