## Research meetings
A research meeting consists of three parts: 
 * Describe your objectives. You may need to remind your supervisor/advisor what you agreed to last time; they are often busy and absent-minded people.
 * Show your progress. There should be at least one plot. If there have been obstacles describe in detail what you tried and the results of the attempts.
 * Update the project plan.  Describe what progress has been made, what progress you expect to make before the next meeting, and when the project will be finished.
 
Take notes! You will forget everything by the next day.
