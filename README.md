# Getting Started (basic skills)

* [Scientific meetings](http://wagner.physics.illinois.edu/2015/03/26/ScienceMeeting/)
* [How to format data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data.html)
* [Using a computer for research](http://software-carpentry.org)

## Writing 

* [Writing links](http://wagner.physics.illinois.edu/communication/2015/01/14/writing/)
* [Celia Elliot's page on writing](http://physics.illinois.edu/people/profile.asp?cmelliot)
* [Writing a PRL](https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/writing/Handouts/prl.html)

## Meetings
If you're not getting scheduling notices for these and you would like to, let Lucas know.
 * Group meeting Wednesdays at 10 AM (ESB 3110)
 * SciDAC collaboration (many-body methods) every other week
 * EFRC-CES-MGI (superconductivity) collaboration every other week

## Talks
You should make an effort to go to the condensed matter talk Fridays at 1 PM and the condensed matter theory talk Monday at noon. I also highly recommend the colloquium at 4 PM on Wednesdays. 
There is also the Electronic Structure Interest Group (ESIG) that meets about every month during the semester.
