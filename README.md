## Meetings
If you're not getting scheduling notices for these and you would like to, let Lucas know.
 * Group meeting Wednesdays at 2 PM (Zoom)
 * Hacktimes wednesday and thursday

## Talks
You should make an effort to go to the condensed matter talk Fridays at 1 PM and the condensed matter theory talk Monday at noon. I also highly recommend the colloquium at 4 PM on Wednesdays. 
There is also the Electronic Structure Interest Group (ESIG) that meets about every month during the semester.
