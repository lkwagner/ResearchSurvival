## Coding rules
 * Make sure that your style is consistent. In our group (thanks Brian), we use CamelCase for classes, underscores and lower_case for functions
 * Document intent, inputs, and outputs for functions. Especially in Python.
 * Try to avoid functions longer than you can read on your screen
 * Be familiar with standard library functions, both in C++ and Python
 * Don't introduce too many non-standard library dependencies.
 * Be aware of encapsulation: if you find yourself trying to access member variables of another class, think hard about what you're doing.
