## How to tell that a paper is good
 * Identifies an important open question in the field.
 * Correctly assesses a way to resolve that open question.
 * Actually does resolve the question correctly
 * Either the result or the method of resolution could be useful!
 
## Critical reading (not the English Literature version)
 * Identify factual statements in the paper. "The sky is blue" is a factual statement.
 * For each factual statement, ask yourself what evidence the author has for that statement. Is it referenced? Do the references actually say the thing that the author claims?
 * How are the factual statements linked? Does one follow from another? 
 * What are the assumptions made in the paper? 
 * Are there implicit assumptions that aren't mentioned?
 * What approximations are made? How large are the approximations for the quantity of interest?
 
 ## Quickly surveying a paper
 Follow this sequence, stopping when you have a good idea of what the paper is saying. 
 There is a judgement call here in assessing whether it's worth reading one paper in detail versus reading several.
  * Read title
  * Read abstract
  * Look at figures and captions
  * Read conclusion
  * Read introduction
  * Read results section
 
 ## Searching literature
  * Think carefully about what you want to learn.
  * Find a good paper on the subject.
  * Find new papers by looking at the authors, references, and citing articles of the good paper.
  * Save the good papers you find in Zotero or some other reference manager
  * Make a presentation with one slide per paper. Include a statement of the main point of the paper and an important figure.
