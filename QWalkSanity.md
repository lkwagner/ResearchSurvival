When you run QMC, there are a number of ways to make sure that the calculation is reasonable:

## Conversion checklist
  * Does the kinetic energy match the mean field?
  * Is the variance of local energy reasonable? (you should be able to figure this out) 
  * Does variance optimization reduce the 'dispersion' (sqrt of variance) by about a factor of 2?
